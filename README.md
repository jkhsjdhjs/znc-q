# znc-q

A ZNC module for authenticating with QuakeNets Q bot.
[It was removed the official ZNC repository](https://github.com/znc/znc/commit/4f446552a3e05da85bebbc89464d48de49562be1), because the maintenance burden is too high for it targeting only a single IRC network.
This repository contains the q module as it was [previously contained the ZNC repository](https://github.com/znc/znc/blob/8d309bbb3dc6bef558a2ffe4f523a0467dda8057/modules/q.cpp).
